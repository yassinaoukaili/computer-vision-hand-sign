# Hand Sign Recognition

## Overview

The Hand Sign Recognition project is a machine learning-based application that detects and classifies hand gestures from real-time video streams. 
This system can be used for sign language interpretation, gesture-based control, and other human-computer interaction tasks.

## Features

  - Real-time hand gesture detection 
  
  - Works with image and video input

## Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset of hand gestures collected via webcam. 
The dataset consists of images captured in real-time using OpenCV.
